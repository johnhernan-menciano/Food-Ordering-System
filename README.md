As my first project in college, I developed a Simple Food Ordering System using Java GUI. This project was designed to streamline the process of ordering food, offering a user-friendly interface and efficient functionality. The system allows users to browse a menu, select items, and place orders with ease.

Features:

1. User Interface: The project features a clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) created using Java Swing components. It includes buttons, labels, text fields, and tables to display the menu and order details.
2. Menu Display: Users can view a list of available food items, complete with descriptions and prices. The menu is dynamically generated and can be easily updated.
3. Order Selection: Users can select items from the menu and specify quantities. Selected items are added to an order list, which displays the current order details.
4. Order Summary: The system provides a summary of the selected items, including the total cost. Users can review their order before finalizing it.

Technologies Used:

Java: The core programming language used for developing the application.
Java Swing: The GUI toolkit used to create the user interface components.
Object-Oriented Programming: The project follows OOP principles for better organization and maintenance of code.
Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Java GUI development, learned to implement event-driven programming, and enhanced my understanding of object-oriented design principles. This project laid the foundation for my future studies and projects in software development.
